<h2>Biography</h2>
<p>I am currently a Msc. student at Department of Applied Mathematics, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU), 
under the supervision of <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/mindai/home">Prof. Min Dai</a> since Feburary 2023. 
Previously, I received my Bachelor's Degrees in Financial Mathematics from <a href="https://www.gxu.edu.cn/">Guangxi University (GXU)</a> in 2022. 
During my undergraduate studies, I took courses in mathematics such as mathematical analysis, advanced algebra, 
probability theory and mathematical statistics, as well as economics courses such as macroeconomics and econometrics, 
and achieved an average score of 92.46. In my graduate studies, I have taken courses in optimization methods, simulation and risk analysis, 
big data computing, and high-dimensional data analysis. During my academic career, I have had the opportunity to conduct research on various 
topics such as stochastic processes, optimization, and risk management. I have worked on several projects related to finance, 
including portfolio optimization, risk assessment, and asset pricing. 
These experiences have allowed me to develop a solid foundation in mathematical modeling and statistical analysis, skills that 
I believe will be essential for my future research in financial mathematics.</p>
